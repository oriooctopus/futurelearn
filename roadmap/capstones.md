- each major section has capstones
- to start a each capstone you have to complete all the required skills first (the lessons)
- each capstone has warm ups (which are simplified versions of the capstones)
- each capstone is like a circle with part of it filled based on how much of the required skills you have. So if you have 75% of the skills then it would be 75% full
