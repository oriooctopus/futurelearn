## Memorization vs figuring things out

- we all have different mental processes for figuring out things
- memorization is the wrong way to go about coding, there are too many combinations
- this is why many people who get straight A's in school have trouble learning coding, because they have a memorization mentality

## Other philosophies

- should aim to reduce the language/culture barrier as much as possible
- money should not be an obstacle to getting the best experience from this
- Success A/B testing
- The less context needed the better. Modules should be as independent as possible. This allows users to jump in from outside the course and learn, and allows us to have more path customization

## In lessons

- If possible, a step in a lesson should always have an exercise. When it doesn't it makes the text in the lesson less impactful because the user isn't doing anything with it
- Gradual learning as opposed to throwing the user in the deep end. There are a lot of benefits of throwing someone in the deep end, but we want to make coding as accessible as possible. I believe it is better to have the deep end come later when they are more qualified and invested into programming (so that it doesn't scare them away)
