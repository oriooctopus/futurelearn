\*\* core

- we keep track of all the concepts. Here is an example:

  - the string data type
  - how to declare a function
  - how to write an inline comment
  - the split method

  Each of these concepts have dependencies. So, if someone wanted to learn about method, they would know that they have to also learn about prototypal inheritence

- Every lesson has more explanations if you opt for the longer option

- Throughout make sure that they understand how the program works line by line

- a why aren't my styles working section. Basically there will be an external stylesheet that is imported that the user can't see, and they have to use the debugger to figure out what's going wrong. For example, a style is getting overridden, the property is invalid, etc.

## ideas base

- SRS
- You can select a category or tag to show up in your srs
- you can select an individual exercise to show up in your srs

- Maybe there are different difficult levels? Each problem has a maximum difficulty level (an easy problem won't show up if a user has medium difficulty selected)

- there are also different kinds of tags such as terminology, that a user can enable. An example would be, what does the word initialization mean?

- We could have different sections: tasks, concepts, terminology

- Open source!!! Other people could create modules that teach their technology

- lots of a/b testing

- calculate a tree with data visualization like in civilization or kingdom rush where you can't get the last upgrade until you get the earlier ones

- You can go to the store with the points you earn

- motivational quotes while loading

- you can make a goal for what you want to build and it will create a map (the data visualization thing) of the skills and preparation (the level you have to get to within those skills as well!) to achieve it

- dynamic pacing (pacing that adjust to how easily you get the answers)

- profiles of common mistakes in mentality/learning process that other learns had

- can add custom flashcards to their srs

- trainer page for current lesson

- perhaps there are specfic debugging exercises, and users can set how many debugging exercises they'd like in their daily exercise settings

- have a react foundations/prep course

- every exercise shows you which things you improved on (so if you did something with objects, the objects module would be improved)

- each exercise you can toggle different levels of explanation depth: brief, code only, to in depth or something

- a quiz you take that shows which skills you have

- different kind of quiz modes, like in quizlet with timed and other mini-games

- don't follow free code camp's lesson style, instead have a sort of developing lesson, that has some text, then leads to a question, then some more text, then question. And then on the left side of the screen you have a like a cheatsheet that has bullet points for the points you've introduced.

  - OH AND THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A PROGRESS BAR LIKE IN DUOLINGO. And that would work perfectly with the final exercises too!

- IT WOULD BE Great if the lesson view would also dedicate a small amount of real estate to show their current track.

- the tracker should also have like 3/10 thing at the bottom

## ideas round 2

- SRS

- line by line understanding

- trainer page for current lesson

- each exercise you can toggle different levels of explanation depth: brief, code only, to in depth or something

- don't follow free code camp's lesson style, instead have a sort of developing lesson, that has some text, then leads to a question, then some more text, then question. And then on the left side of the screen you have a like a cheatsheet that has bullet points for the points you've introduced.

  - OH AND THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A PROGRESS BAR LIKE IN DUOLINGO. And that would work perfectly with the final exercises too!

- IT WOULD BE Great if the lesson view would also dedicate a small amount of real estate to show their current track.

- the tracker should also have like 3/10 thing at the bottom

- Each lesson has a set of (probably hidden) tags that represent the skills learned
