- Calculated from both number of time and number of exercises

- When you arrive at an exercises if you have a relevant SRS a popup will display saying you have X amount of relevant exercises before trying this problem
  - maybe the willingness to do this (like how many, and the minimum amount to display before displaying the notification, should be customized)
  - Honestly I don't know how easily we can automatically calculate which exercises are important precursor exercises... but we could manually add that. Like each lessons has a precursor exercises property
