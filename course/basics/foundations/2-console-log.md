1. Introduction - and have them console log a value there

The console.log() method writes a message to the console.

The console is useful for testing purposes, and can be used to display information that helps us understand our code. Every major browser has a console, but to make things easier, we are displaying it for you on this page. Try it out! Paste in the following code and see how the console will now display a message

```
console.log("This is a very cool console message")
```

You should now see `This is a very cool console message`. You may notice that there are no quotes surrounding `This is a very cool console message` in the console. This is because those quotes are only used to tell the computer that what ever is in it is a string, but they are not necessary when communicating with us.

2. Have them declare a variable then use that

```
Exercise: Another exercise, Have them pass in a label and a value to console log. Have the code start with the previous exercise, and then ask them to refactor that to use a variable
```

3. Where to find the console.log. Include a gif for each major browser. Say that this only applies to laptops and desktops, and that finding the console is more difficult on others

4. Wrapping up - usefulness of console log

In our coding journey, we'll frequently use console.log to write messages and to _debug_, which is the process of figuring out why code doesn't work. As we'll see later on, console.log is one of the most valuable tools we have when debugging.

```
Exercise: Write the message "goodbye!"
Exercise: Multiple choice (selecting multiple) about the usefulness of console.log)
```

## Map

1. Introduction

- Have them just log something (outside of a function). Don't get technical by saying stuff like parameter. Instead say that what you want to log goes between the paranthesis. Make sure to emphasize (through exercises) that only paranthesis work

2. Do what we were doing for them in the earlier lessons where we were console logging the result of the functions

3. Console log on separate lines
4. log multiple things in same line
5. console.log is a function

- functions are what make code reusable, powerful, and they hide complex information and have it done simply. Logging information to a console is actually a difficult process (ideally show an overview of everything that happens), but because this is all defined in a function, using it only takes one line of code.

we do this first so they get in the habit of using it
probably have them log a number
