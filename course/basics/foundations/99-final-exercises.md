- Job application exercise: Similar to the mega console log, but a more real world (and difficult) example of the usefulness of functions. Have them pass in a name and combine that with like 'hi ' + companyName, 'blah blah blah'
- Have them do a function that calls another function
- fix some code (stuff like incorrect variable names or wrong paranthesis in the console log)
